\markdownRendererUlItem We can think of electric fields as an area permeated space where any mass placed in this field would experience a force because of an interaction with the field.\markdownRendererUlItemEnd 
\markdownRendererUlItem Electric field lines always point away from positive source charges and towards negative ones. Such pairs are called \markdownRendererStrongEmphasis{electric dipoles}.\markdownRendererUlItemEnd

{}For all practical purposes, the field near the middle is uniform. Therefore, you can use kinematics just like we did near the surface of the earth.\markdownRendererInterblockSeparator

\markdownRendererUlItem The electric field inside a conductor is $0$.\markdownRendererUlItemEnd 
\markdownRendererUlItem Any excess charge on a conductor resides entirely on the outer surface.\markdownRendererUlItemEnd 
\markdownRendererUlItem When doing calculations with other charges outside of the metal ball, treat the metal ball as a singular charge, with its charge being centered, and having a value of $\sum outer$.\markdownRendererUlItemEnd 
\markdownRendererUlItem You can induce a charge inside a conductor by bringing a charge closer.\markdownRendererUlItemEnd

\markdownRendererUlItem Recall that the work done is the area under a curve for a PV diagram. Therefore, you can make optimizations by either first increasing $P$ or $V$, depending on what the question is asking.\markdownRendererUlItemEnd 
\markdownRendererUlItem Unlike other forces, the work done by $PV$ diagrams is \markdownRendererStrongEmphasis{not conservative} this means that it is \markdownRendererStrongEmphasis{path-dependent}, which further emphasizes the points written above.\markdownRendererUlItemEnd
